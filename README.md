 # ðŸ”‹ Digital Battery Passport Backend (Microservices Architecture)

An intelligent backend platform built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Kafka, Nodemailer and s3 support to manage digital battery passports. It follows a scalable microservices architecture and supports JWT-based authentication, event-driven communication, file storage, and role-based access control between (user and admin).

- Issues JWTs
- Role-based access control
- No external database exposure

### 2. **Battery Passport Service** (`localhost:5002`)
- CRUD for battery passports
- Authenticated via JWT
- Emits Kafka events: `passport.created`, `passport.updated`, `passport.deleted`

### 3. **Document Service** (`localhost:5003`)
- Upload/download/delete files (S3-compatible) 
- Real time data upload, URL, on s3 storage
- Stores file metadata in MongoDB
- Authenticated via JWT

### 4. **Notification Service** (`localhost:5004`)
- Kafka consumer for passport events
- simulates real-time notifications to email with Nodemailer
